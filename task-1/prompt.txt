"Apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to analyze the given project requirements and select the most suitable type of database. Follow these steps:

Understand the Requirements:

Identify key characteristics:

Social platform with millions of users

Data types: profiles, posts, user connections

Performance: High read speed (80% reads, 20% writes)

Critical need: Scalability for growing user base

Evaluate Database Types:

Compare relational (SQL) vs. non-relational (NoSQL) databases.

Consider subcategories (e.g., document, graph, key-value stores).

Assess how each handles:

Read/write performance

Scalability (horizontal vs. vertical)

Data model flexibility (structured vs. unstructured)

Match Requirements to Database Strengths:

High read speed → Optimized for queries, caching, indexing.

User connections → Graph-like relationships (e.g., friends/followers).

Scalability → Distributed systems, partitioning/sharding support.

Shortlist Candidates:

Example: Graph databases (for connections), document stores (for profiles/posts), or hybrid approaches.

Justify why certain types are eliminated (e.g., pure key-value lacks relationship handling).

Select and Justify:

Choose the best type (or combination) and explain how it meets each requirement.

Address trade-offs (e.g., consistency vs. availability if relevant).

Final output should clearly walk through the reasoning chain and conclude with a specific database recommendation."
